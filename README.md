# UniformArch - An LLM & Neural Network Architecture:
The UniformArch is an LLM architecture designed to look at the whole context of text and analyze each word on how they connect to each-other, similar to the *TRANSFORMER* architecture and using the same, "Self-Attention". Except, it analyzes it hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of times to get the best results of how it would understand it and how it would be executed if written in a context. For example, if I made an LLM based on top of the *UniformArch* and trained it on one book from the victorian era: It would analyze the given book text and repeat looking at it over and over again until it feels like it has enough information to understand how it would write like that.
