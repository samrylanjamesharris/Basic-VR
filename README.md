# UniformArch [Uniform Architecture]
The UniformArch is an LLM architecture designed to look at the whole context of text and alayze each word on how they connect to each-other, similiar to the TRANSFORMER architecture and using the same, "Self-AttExcept, it analyzes it hundreds upon hundreds of times to get the best results of how it would understand it and how it would be executed if written in a context. For example, if I made an LLM based on top of the UniformArch and trained it on one book from the victorain era: It would analyze the given book text and repeat looking at it over andd over again until it feels like it has enough infomation to understand how it would write like that. Of course, it wouldn't be perfect but it's and idea worth exploring to give change from the useal TRANSFORMER architecture.
